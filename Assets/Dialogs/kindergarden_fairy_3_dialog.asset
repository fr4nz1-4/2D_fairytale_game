  dialogText:
  - Thank you so much. Now what did you want to tell me?
  - I'm not your new assistant.
  - Why didn't you say something sooner?
  - Because I tried and you didn't listen!
  - "I\u2019m, sorry. Sometimes these kids are driving me insane. If you're not the
    new assistant, why are you here?"
  - To find the room that will grant me one wish. Is the legend real?
  - Great. Awesome. How do I get there?
  - Well that is going to be the tricky part.
  - I have done lots of tricky things. This won't be a problem.
  - --LAUGHING--- You see there are four different keys to open the room of wishes.
    The keys are in possession of four different people living in this tree. And
    to be completely honest. They probably won't give you their keys.
  - What? Why?
  - For starters, because they are occupied with their own problems and don't know
    how to handle them. And some of the citizens of this tree sadly don't get along.
    There was a high fairy one, but they disappeared. Since then everything was out
    of order and the people stopped communicating with each other.
  - I wish it was different! Every time the parents are picking up their children
    from me there is a lot of Drama. They don't want there children playing with
    each other.
  - I just wish I could be like the high fairy and bring everybody together.
  - ...
  - Unfortunately I am not.
  - ...
  - But maybe you are......
  - OMG, I have the perfect Idea! You are going to help me resolve this conflict.
  - And why would I?
  - You're perfect for the job. You're new and full of energy and have the time to
    do it. You're so much more like the high fairy was. Come on it will be fun.
  - I don't see why it would be fun and I should help you. I'm here to find the Room
    of Wishes.
  - Exactly. If you help the people resolve their conflicts they have the time to
    search for their keys.
  - ...
  - The keys you will need to open the Room of Wishes.
  - ...
  - And...
  - ...
  - I happen to have one of the keys. If you help me resolve the conflicts I will
    give you my key.
  - (Unfortunately I probably need the keys. And they are right. I need them for
    my Quest. I should make the deal and start talking to the other citizens. I can
    do it)
  - Alright I'll help you.
  - Perfect great. Thank you so much. You won't regret it.
  - We'll see. Where should I start?
  - Oh you can start at my next door neighbour. Mellifera. They are in charge of
    growing our produce and flowers. Very important. Good luck.
  - Thanks.

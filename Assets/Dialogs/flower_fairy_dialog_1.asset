  - '#Just a nice suggestion on my part.'

  - '@I''m here to get your key for the room of wishes.'
  - '#And why should I give it to you?'
  - '@Ella told me that you had some problems I could fix in exchange to get your
    key.'
  - '#Problems? I don''t have problems!'
  - '@Really? Because I saw the broken flowerbeds. It does not look like you can
    handle them on your own.'
  - '#Hmpf... It is very hard to take care of the garden. I don''t have time to fix
    thoes beds. And even if I''ll fix them the problem won''t go away.'
  - '#Mari would throw more potions down and it will become a mess again.'
  - '@Who is Mari?'
  - '#That very careless person. They own the pub right above me. Their potions always
    find there way down into my beautiful flowerbeds and ruin everything I work so
    hard for.'
  - '@Ok, so how can I help you?'
  - '#Didn''t you listen to me? You can''t! It will always happen over and over again.'
  - '@Ok, but if I find a way to help you, can I have your key?'
  - '#I guess if you could find a way this problem goes away you could have my key.'
  - '@Perfect. I''ll get the problem fixed.'
  - '#I''m not sure you will.'

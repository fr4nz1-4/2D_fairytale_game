  dialogText:
  - I have travelled through a lot of different worlds, swam through raging rivers,
    climbed steep mountains and a lot more to be here today. To be standing on this
    very ground, to hope for a better and easier future.
  - ...
  - I can finally see it, this beautiful, magnificent tree. All of it was worth it.
    This tree will be my salvation. Ancient legends say the tree is magic, that somewhere
    inside this tree, there is a room, and if you enter the room you will be granted
    one wish.
  - ...
  - 'That''s what I''m here for. That''s why I travelled so far. To be granted that
    one wish. '
  - ...
  - 'I just need to find the room. I overcame so much this will be child''s play.
    The residents of this tree will for sure know where I need to go. Let me just
    go talk to one of them. '
